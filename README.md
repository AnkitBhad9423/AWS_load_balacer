# AWS Load Balancer 

## Overview

This repository showcases a project demonstrating the functionality of an AWS Load Balancer using two virtual machines (VMs). The project illustrates step-by-step how to create and configure VMs, host a website on each VM, set up a target group, and configure a load balancer to distribute traffic between the VMs. The goal is to show how traffic is automatically managed between multiple VMs to handle increased load efficiently.

## Project Details

### Steps Covered

#### Creating Virtual Machines (VMs)

- Detailed instructions on how to create two VMs on AWS.
- Images showing the VM creation.

#### Configuring VMs

- Instructions on setting up each VM, including network configurations and security settings.
- Images demonstrating the VM configuration process.

#### Hosting Websites

- Step-by-step guide on hosting a simple website on each VM.
- Screenshots showing the websites running on both VMs.

#### Creating a Target Group

- Instructions on creating an AWS target group to manage the VMs.
- Images showing the creation of the target group.

#### Setting Up a Load Balancer

- Step-by-step guide on creating an AWS load balancer and associating it with the target group.
- Screenshots of the load balancer setup and configuration.

#### Traffic Management

- Demonstration of how the load balancer distributes traffic between the two VMs.
- Example images showing how the load balancer automatically switches traffic when one VM experiences high load.

## Repository Contents

- **Images**: Screenshots of the entire setup process, including VM creation, target group setup, website hosting, and load balancer configuration.

## How to Use

 **Review the Images**: Start by reviewing the images provided in this repository to understand the setup process.
 **Monitor Traffic**: Once set up, observe how the load balancer distributes traffic between the VMs, especially under varying traffic conditions.

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account with necessary permissions to create and manage VMs, target groups, and load balancers.
- Basic knowledge of AWS services and networking.
